## HAR using Classical Machine Learning models and LSTM models.
### Models used in Human Activity Recognition:
(1) LSTM Model
(2) Logistic regression with GridSearch
(3) Linear SVM with GridSearch
(4) Kernal SVM with GridSearch
(5) Random Forest with GridSearch

### Some Basic Libraries
``` python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import nltk
%matplotlib inline


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, Confusion_matrix, Classification_report

```
